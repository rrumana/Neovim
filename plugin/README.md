# Neovim
This was my setup as of a few weeks ago. I decided I would spend a month or two wsith it to see what I like, dislike, and what needs to be changed. I am in the process of remapping things to better suit my needs and habits, expect an update to this repository soon.

This will be a very dynamic repo  as I explore Neovim over the coming months.

This Neovim config was inspired by the Primeagen's Neovim config video. I haven't made many changes yet but I plan to change many of the keybinds to better suit my typing habits. I also plan to add some different plugins and whatnot. I will add a more detaild list of plugins and config details later.

I am currently experimenting with Copilot turnd off, I will post my thoughts on that here.
