# Neovim

I have finally updated away from packer.nvim after a few years of development using it. I really enjoyed the simplicity of packer, if it were still maintained I would still be using it. I have replaced it with Lazy.nvim, which has active development, a thriving community, and more features even if I won't use many of them often.

Copilot review:
Copilot is a pretty good tool all things considered, but it is not something I would keep on all the time. It is wonderful for autofilling in simple methods from the function signature and creating unit tests, but I find it to be not worth much more than that. It still halucinates often on syntax, and is less useful than an LSP when it comes to autocomplete for less common function calls. Copilot also has the downside of being behind on the times when it comes to certain plugins, packages, and crates. If a project dependency has switched from version 1.0 to 2.0 between the model's training time and now it is near useless, which is difficult for me since I like to operate in the the Rust machine learning field, which is changing quickly and has a relatively small userbase compared to things copilot is good at like React, CSS, and Python.
