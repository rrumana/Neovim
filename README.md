# Neovim
My current Neovim Setup

This will be a very dynamic repo  as I explore Neovim over the coming months.

This Neovim config was inspired by the Primeagen's Neovim config video. I haven't made many changes yet but I plan to change many of the keybinds to better suit my typing habits. I also plan to add some different plugins and whatnot. I will add a more detaild list of plugins and config details later.
